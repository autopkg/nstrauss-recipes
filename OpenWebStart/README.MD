[OpenWebStart settings](https://openwebstart.com/configuration/) are configurable with a response.varfile. Modify the varfile to match preferred settings before building the package.

Postinstall script runs an [unattended install](https://openwebstart.com/installation/) to configure settings in response.varfile, and then clean up install files.
